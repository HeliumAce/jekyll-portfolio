I was the Head of Design of Trello from Feb 2021 until Feb 2023. During that time we doubled our team size, delivered a product & experience vision and shipped many significant product improvements. 

## Team & culture
During the Covid years we placed additional emphasis on team health and culture. Trello was already leading the charge as a remote-first workplace, but with attrition increasing we wanted to ensure we were supporting our people with as much intent as possible.
